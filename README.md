# Environments
This is a _mobile_ application developed using Unity in C#, making use of the Vuforia library.

A more detailed timeline of the development of this project can be seen on [this](http://graphics.kieranmason.co.uk/Environments) website.
There is a lot of content on that website so load times are not expected to be instantaneous.

## Warning
As of 2017.2, Unity is integrated with the Vuforia Engine, meaning that this project is no longer compatible with recent versions of Unity.
I've no intention of updating the project as it was for a marked exam.
